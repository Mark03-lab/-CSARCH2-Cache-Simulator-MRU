Cache Memory Simulator
Overview
The Cache Memory Simulator is a web-based tool designed to simulate the behavior of a Block-Set Associative Cache with the Most Recently Used (MRU) replacement policy. It allows users to configure various cache and memory parameters, simulate cache operations, and analyze the results.

Features
Configurable Cache Parameters: Set block size, number of sets, cache size, and cycle times.
Program Flow Input: Enter a sequence of memory accesses to simulate.
Simulation Results: View cache hits, misses, miss penalty, average memory access time, and total memory access time.
Memory Snapshot: See the state of the cache memory after simulation.
Download Results: Export simulation results to a text file.
